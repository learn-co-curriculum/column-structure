## Column Structure using CSS

## Problem Statement

the right combination of properties, building columns with CSS create a responsive-friendly
layout option that degrades gracefully.

## Conclusion

While this is only one example of how to format columns, we've provided the groundwork for
understanding how side-by-side elements interact on the page, and how a number of different
properties can affect the flow. Understanding these properties will be useful as you become
familiar with "fluid" versus "responsive" layouts.
